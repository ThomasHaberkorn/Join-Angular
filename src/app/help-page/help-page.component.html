                <p>Welcome to the help page for <span class="blue">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban project
                    management tool. Here, we'll
                    provide an overview of what <span class="blue">Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to
                    use it.</p>
                <h2>What is Join?</h2>
                <p><span class="blue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
                    group of dedicated students as
                    part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. <br><br>

                    Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                    work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="blue">Join</span> leverages the
                    principles of kanban to help
                    users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface. <br><br>

                    It is important to note that <span class="blue">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise
                    and is not intended for

                            <p>When you log in to <span class="blue">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This
                                board represents your project and
                                contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>

                                projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                                click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts
                                can
                                be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>

                                tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
